# DevOps Crisis Simulator - Game Rules

## Setting & Background

Welcome to **TechFlow Dynamics**, a cutting-edge software company that's just landed a massive contract to build the next generation of cloud infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies. Your team has 90 days to deliver a revolutionary platform that promises to change how businesses manage their digital operations.

But here's the catch: Murphy's Law is in full effect. Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. From critical production bugs to surprise security audits, from viral feature launches that crash your servers to cloud provider outages that happen at the worst possible moment.

Your mission? Navigate through the chaos, make strategic decisions under pressure, and somehow deliver a product that doesn't just work—but excels. Every decision matters. Every role counts. One wrong move and your startup dreams could turn into a corporate nightmare.

## Game Structure

### Turn Overview
Each turn represents **one week** in your development cycle and consists of three phases:

1. **🗳️ Voting Phase** (2-3 minutes)
2. **⚡ Events Phase** (1-2 minutes)  
3. **🎯 Execution Phase** (2-3 minutes)

### Metrics That Matter
Your team's success is measured across two critical dimensions:

**📈 Business Metrics** (0-100)
- **Revenue**: Direct income from your product
- **Customer Satisfaction**: How happy your users are
- **Market Share**: Your competitive position
- **Brand Reputation**: Public perception of your company

**⚙️ DevOps Metrics** (0-100)  
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and stability
- **Security Posture**: Protection against threats
- **Performance**: Speed and responsiveness
- **Team Velocity**: How fast you can deliver features

## Phase Breakdown

### 🗳️ Phase 1: Voting Phase

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**What Happens**: 
Three random challenges appear from your backlog. These could be anything from "Critical Bug in Production" to "New Feature Request" to "Security Vulnerability." 

**Your Mission**:
- Review each challenge's difficulty and requirements
- Discuss as a team (quickly!) which challenge to tackle
- Each player votes for ONE challenge
- The challenge with the most votes becomes your focus for this turn

**Strategic Considerations**:
- Match challenges to your team composition
- Consider the required vs. preferred strengths
- Balance urgent fixes with strategic improvements
- Remember: harder challenges can yield bigger rewards... or bigger disasters

### ⚡ Phase 2: Events Phase

**Duration**: 1-2 minutes

**What Happens**:
The universe throws you a curveball. A random event occurs that can dramatically shift your situation.

**Possible Events**:
- **🌩️ Cloud Provider Outage**: Your infrastructure goes down at the worst possible moment
- **🎯 DDoS Attack**: Malicious actors target your systems
- **🚀 Feature Goes Viral**: Sudden success that overwhelms your capacity
- **👥 Key Team Member Leaves**: Critical expertise walks out the door
- **💰 Major Client Signs**: New revenue but increased pressure
- **🔍 Security Audit**: Regulatory compliance check
- **📱 Mobile App Launch**: New platform, new complexity
- **⚡ Performance Spike**: Mysterious system improvements

**Impact**: Events can boost or damage your metrics, change the difficulty of future challenges, or introduce special conditions for the next turn.

### 🎯 Phase 3: Execution Phase

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**What Happens**:
Your team works on ALL voted tasks simultaneously. Each vote contributes progress toward task completion.

**Execution Mechanics**:
1. **Progress Calculation**: Each vote = 1/x progress (where x = number of players)
2. **Role Effectiveness**: Players voting for tasks matching their strengths count as double progress
3. **Task Completion**: Tasks reaching 100% progress are completed and provide benefits
4. **Incomplete Tasks**: Tasks not completed remain in the voting pool for next turn

**Progress Examples**:
- 4 players, 1 task gets 3 votes: 3/4 = 75% progress (carries over)
- 4 players, 2 votes from roles with matching strengths: 4/4 = 100% (completed!)
- Multiple tasks can be worked on simultaneously based on vote distribution

## Lore & Flavor Text

### The TechFlow Dynamics Story

Your product, **CloudSync Pro**, promises to revolutionize how enterprises manage their cloud infrastructure. The demo videos are slick, the investors are excited, and the launch deadline is non-negotiable.

But behind the glossy marketing materials and confident press releases lies the reality every software team knows: building great software is part engineering, part art, and part pure survival instinct.

Welcome to the beautiful chaos of modern software development. Your stakeholders are watching. Your competitors are gaining ground. Your servers are making weird noises.

Time to find out what your team is really made of.
