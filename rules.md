# DevOps Crisis Simulator - Game Rules

## Setting & Background

Welcome to **TechFlow Dynamics**, a cutting-edge software company that's on a critical 90-day probation period. After a series of missteps and missed deadlines, the board has made it clear: prove your team can deliver, or face being replaced by external consultants.

Your mission is to navigate through the chaos of modern software development while proving your worth. From critical production bugs to surprise security audits, from viral feature launches that crash your servers to cloud provider outages that happen at the worst possible moment - every decision matters.

This is your chance to prove that your team has what it takes. Navigate the challenges, make strategic decisions under pressure, and show the company that you're not just survivors, but the reliable professionals they need. Every role counts. Every turn matters. One wrong move and your career could be on the line.

## Game Overview

**DevOps Crisis Simulator** is a strategic team-based game where 3-8 players take on different roles in a software development team. Together, you'll face a series of challenges, make critical decisions, and watch as your choices ripple through both your technical infrastructure and business success.

The game simulates the real pressures of modern software development: tight deadlines, unexpected crises, resource constraints, and the constant balancing act between moving fast and maintaining quality.

## Player Roles & Specialties

Each player chooses a role with unique strengths and special powers. The available roles are defined in the game's configuration and may include various engineering disciplines like Development, Quality Assurance, DevOps, Product Ownership, Security Engineering, and Site Reliability Engineering.

Each role has:
- **Specific strengths** that make them more effective at certain types of tasks
- **Unique special powers** that can be used once per game to dramatically impact the situation
- **Clear responsibilities** that help guide decision-making during the game

Players should familiarize themselves with their role's capabilities and understand how they can best contribute to the team's success.


## Game Structure

### Turn Overview
Each turn represents **one week** in your development cycle and consists of three phases:

1. **🗳️ Voting Phase** (2-3 minutes)
2. **⚡ Events Phase** (1-2 minutes)  
3. **🎯 Execution Phase** (2-3 minutes)

### Metrics That Matter
Your team's success is measured across two critical dimensions:

**📈 Business Metrics** (0-100)
- **Business Income**: Direct revenue and profitability
- **Security Score**: Protection against threats and compliance
- **Performance Score**: System speed and responsiveness  
- **Reputation**: Public and customer perception
- **Technical Debt** (0-100): Accumulated shortcuts and maintenance needs

**⚙️ DevOps Metrics** (0-100)  
- **Deployment Frequency**: How often you can deploy
- **Lead Time**: Time from code to production
- **MTTR**: Mean time to recovery from incidents
- **Change Failure Rate**: Success rate of deployments

## Phase Breakdown

### 🗳️ Phase 1: Voting Phase

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**What Happens**: 
Three random challenges appear from your backlog. These could be anything from "Critical Bug in Production" to "New Feature Request" to "Security Vulnerability." 

**Your Mission**:
- Review each challenge's difficulty and requirements
- Discuss as a team (quickly!) which challenge to tackle
- Each player votes for ONE challenge
- The challenge with the most votes becomes your focus for this turn

**Strategic Considerations**:
- Match challenges to your team composition
- Consider the required vs. preferred strengths
- Balance urgent fixes with strategic improvements
- Remember: harder challenges can yield bigger rewards... or bigger disasters

### ⚡ Phase 2: Events Phase

**Duration**: 1-2 minutes

**What Happens**:
The universe throws you a curveball. A random event occurs that can dramatically shift your situation.

**Possible Events**:
- **🌩️ Cloud Provider Outage**: Your infrastructure goes down at the worst possible moment
- **🎯 DDoS Attack**: Malicious actors target your systems
- **🚀 Feature Goes Viral**: Sudden success that overwhelms your capacity
- **👥 Key Team Member Leaves**: Critical expertise walks out the door
- **💰 Major Client Signs**: New revenue but increased pressure
- **🔍 Security Audit**: Regulatory compliance check
- **📱 Mobile App Launch**: New platform, new complexity
- **⚡ Performance Spike**: Mysterious system improvements

**Impact**: Events can boost or damage your metrics, change the difficulty of future challenges, or introduce special conditions for the next turn.

### 🎯 Phase 3: Execution Phase

**Duration**: 2-3 minutes

**What Happens**:
Your team works on ALL voted tasks simultaneously. Each vote contributes progress toward task completion.

**Execution Mechanics**:
1. **Progress Calculation**: Each vote = 1/x progress (where x = number of players)
2. **Role Effectiveness**: Players voting for tasks matching their strengths count as double progress
3. **Technical Debt Impact**: Higher technical debt increases the progress needed to complete tasks
4. **Task Completion**: Tasks reaching 100% progress are completed and provide benefits
5. **Incomplete Tasks**: Tasks not completed remain in the voting pool for next turn
6. **Special Powers**: Players can use their role's special power once per game to dramatically impact the situation
7. **Reducing Technical Debt**: Players can vote to work on reducing technical debt instead of specific tasks

**Progress Examples**:
- 4 players, 1 task gets 3 votes: 3/4 = 75% progress (carries over)
- 4 players, 2 votes from roles with matching strengths: 4/4 = 100% (completed!)
- Multiple tasks can be worked on simultaneously based on vote distribution
- **Technical Debt Impact**: Higher technical debt increases the progress needed to complete tasks

## Lore & Flavor Text

### The TechFlow Dynamics Story

Founded in a cramped San Francisco garage by three Stanford dropouts with a revolutionary idea, TechFlow Dynamics has grown from a weekend hackathon project to a Series B startup with $50M in funding. But recent setbacks have put the entire team under scrutiny.

After missing several critical deadlines and experiencing high-profile outages, the board has issued an ultimatum: **prove your team can deliver within 90 days, or face replacement by external consultants.**

Your product, **CloudSync Pro**, promises to revolutionize how enterprises manage their cloud infrastructure. The technology is sound, but execution has been rocky. Every decision now carries weight. Every mistake could be your last.

This is your chance to prove that internal teams can outperform expensive consultants. Show the board that you understand the product, the technology, and the company better than anyone else could.

Time to find out what your team is really made of. The clock is ticking. The board is watching. Your future depends on the next 90 days.
